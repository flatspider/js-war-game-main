// Listen for the new game button. 

// When new game button CLICKED, call the new game function. 

// New game function will look at a deck of cards.

// Shuffle the deck. 

// Randomly assign (or alternately) assign 26 cards. 

// Player 1 will now have 26 cards in their personal deck. 

// Player 2 will now have 26 cards in their personal deck. 

// BEGIN GAME.

// Click the DRAW button. 

// Player 1 contributes the first card from their deck. 

// Player 2 contributes the first card from their deck. 

// The computer evaluates player1.deck.card.value to player2.deck.card.value. 

// Look at the symbol. Determine what value each card has. 

// Directly compare the values. The higher value card wins. Aces are the highest card. 

// If player 1 wins, take the two cards currently displayed and place them into Player 1s deck. 

// If player 2 has the higher evaluated card, take the two cards currently evaluated and place them into Player 2 deck. 

// First iteration: If the values are the same, Player 1 wins. 

// This means deck array + current card1 and current card2. 

// The game now stands at Player1 Deck = 28 and Player 2 deck = 24. 

// Click the draw button and restart.
